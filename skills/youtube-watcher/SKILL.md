# YouTube Watcher

Fetch transcripts from YouTube videos to enable summarization, QA, and content extraction.

## Usage

### Get Transcript

Retrieve the text transcript of a video.

```bash
cd ~/clawd && source .venv/bin/activate
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/get_transcript.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

## Examples

**Summarize a video:**

1. Get the transcript:
   ```bash
   python3 {baseDir}/scripts/get_transcript.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
   ```
2. Read the output and summarize it for the user.

**Find specific information:**

1. Get the transcript.
2. Search the text for keywords or answer the user's question based on the content.

## Notes

- Requires `yt-dlp` to be installed and available in the PATH.
- Works with videos that have closed captions (CC) or auto-generated subtitles.
- If a video has no subtitles, the script will fail with an error message.

## VPS Setup (via SOCKS Proxy)

YouTube blocks datacenter IPs. On VPS, route through residential IP:

```bash
cd ~/clawd && source .venv/bin/activate
YOUTUBE_PROXY=socks5://localhost:1080 python3 skills/youtube-watcher/scripts/get_transcript.py "URL"
```

**Note:** Use the venv's yt-dlp (updated) rather than the system one.

### Environment Variables
- `YOUTUBE_PROXY` or `SOCKS_PROXY` — SOCKS5 proxy URL (e.g., `socks5://localhost:1080`)

The SSH tunnel to Pi must be running:
```bash
systemctl --user status immoweb-tunnel.service
```
